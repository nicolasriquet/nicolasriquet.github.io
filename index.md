# Nicolas Riquet's homepage

I am a Belgian computer scientist and technology manager.

I earned a Msc in Computer Science from the [University of Namur](https://www.unamur.be/en) and have been working since 2005 in various industries: pharmaceutical industry, space industry, and government. I have held various positions in software engineering, R&D and technical management.

## Professional experience

After getting my Masterâ€™s degree in 2005 I joined [Eli Lilly and Company](https://www.lilly.com/) as a **system analyst / software engineer** where I took part in the development of **molecule analysis software and in the development of a lab asset management application**.

I was then hired by [Rhea Systems](https://www.rheagroup.com/) as a **software engineer** where I worked on various applications for **managing and simulating the execution of spacecraft flight procedures**. I also developed **spacecraft telemetry data analysis software**, as well as an **interpreter and integrated development environment for an industry-specific scripting language** called PLUTO.  This job gave me the opportunity of working on *European Space Missions* such as [Galileo](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Navigation/Galileo/What_is_Galileo) (global navigation satellite system), [Herschel-Planck](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Herschel/ESA_to_launch_two_large_observatories_to_look_deep_into_space_and_time) (space observatories), and [ATV](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/ATV/Mission_concept_and_the_role_of_ATV) (expendable cargo spacecraft).

I later joined [Forem](https://www.leforem.be/what-can-le-forem-do-for-you.html), Public Service for Employment and Vocational Training in Wallonia, Belgium, as a **systems architect**. My responsibilities included the architecture of the information system, technical design of new applications, technical standards, technology research, technical studies, and proofs of concept. I am still currently working at Forem where I hold the position of **Head of Software Engineering Productivity, leading a team of 21 software/DevOps engineers and architects**.

## Research

I am conducting research in the field of **Software Engineering**. My research interests are the following: empirical software engineering, data science in software engineering, technical debt, information systems architecture, DevOps, software engineering for machine learning.
