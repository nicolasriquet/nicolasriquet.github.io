# Welcome to Nicolas Riquet's homepage

I am a Belgian computer scientist, systems architect, and software engineer.

I hold a Master (M2) of Science in Computer Science from the [University of Namur](https://www.unamur.be/en) and have been working since 2005 in various industries: pharmaceutical industry, space industry, and government. I have held various positions in software engineering, R&D and technical management.

## Professional experience

After getting my degree I joined [Eli Lilly and Company](https://www.lilly.com/) as a **system analyst / software engineer** where I took part in the development of *molecule analysis- and lab asset management software*.

I was then hired by [Rhea Systems](https://www.rheagroup.com/) as a **software engineer** and I worked on various applications for *managing and simulating the execution of spacecraft flight procedures, and for analyzing spacecraft telemetry data*. I also developed an *interpreter and integrated development environment* for an industry-specific scripting language called PLUTO. This job gave me the opportunity of working on *European Space Missions* such as [Galileo](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Navigation/Galileo/What_is_Galileo) (global navigation satellite system), [Herschel-Planck](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Herschel/ESA_to_launch_two_large_observatories_to_look_deep_into_space_and_time) (space observatories), and [ATV](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/ATV/Mission_concept_and_the_role_of_ATV) (expendable cargo spacecraft).

I later joined [Forem](https://www.leforem.be/what-can-le-forem-do-for-you.html), Public Service for Employment and Vocational Training in Wallonia, Belgium, as a **systems architect**. My responsibilities included the architecture of the information system, the technical design of new applications, code reviews, technology research, technical studies, and proofs of concept. I am still currently working at Forem where I hold the position of **Head of Software Engineering Productivity and R&D, leading a team of 21 software/DevOps engineers and architects**.

## Research

I will **soon be starting a PhD in Computer Science**, in the field of Software Engineering. My research interests are the following: empirical software engineering, data-driven software development, technical debt, DevOps, software engineering for machine learning.
