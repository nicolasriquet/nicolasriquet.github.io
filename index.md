## Welcome to Nicolas Riquet's homepage

I am a Belgian computer scientist, systems architect, and software engineer.

I hold a Master of Science in Computer Science from the [University of Namur](https://www.unamur.be/en) and have been working in the industry since 2005. After getting my degree I joined [Eli Lilly and Company](https://www.lilly.com/) (pharmaceutical industry) as a system analyst / software engineer where I took part in the development of molecule analysis- and lab asset management software.

I was then hired by [Rhea Systems](https://www.rheagroup.com/) (space industry) as a software engineer and I worked on various applications for managing and simulating the execution of spacecraft flight procedures, and for analyzing spacecraft telemetry data. I also developed an interpreter and integrated development environment for an industry-specific scripting language called PLUTO. This job gave him the opportunity of working on European Space Missions such as Galileo (global navigation satellite system), Herschel-Planck (space observatories), and ATV (expendable cargo spacecraft).

I later joined [Forem](https://www.leforem.be/what-can-le-forem-do-for-you.html), Public Service for Employment and Vocational Training in Wallonia, Belgium, as a systems architect. My responsibilities included the architecture of the information system, the technical design of new applications, code reviews, technology research, technical studies, and proofs of concept. I am still currently working at Forem whereh I hold the position of Head of Software Engineering Productivity and RHD where I lead a team of 21 engineers and architects.
