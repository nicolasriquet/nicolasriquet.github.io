# Nicolas Riquet's homepage

Welcome to my homepage!

I am a Belgian computer scientist and technology manager. I have been working since 2005 in various environments (pharmaceutics and space industries but also government) and I have had the opportunity of holding various positions in software engineering, software/systems architecture, R&D and management.

I also conduct research in Computer Science / Software Engineering at the [University of Namur](https://www.unamur.be/en) as a PhD student.

## Education

I earned a MSc in Computer Science from the University of Namur in 2005 and I started a PhD in Computer Science in 2021 (also at the University of Namur).

## Professional experience

After getting my Masterâ€™s degree in 2005 I joined [Eli Lilly and Company](https://www.lilly.com/) as a system analyst / software engineer where I took part in the development of molecule analysis software and in the development of a lab asset management application.

I was then hired by [Rhea Systems](https://www.rheagroup.com/) as a software engineer where I worked on various applications for managing and simulating the execution of spacecraft flight procedures. I also developed spacecraft telemetry data analysis software, as well as an interpreter and integrated development environment for an industry-specific scripting language called PLUTO.  This job gave me the opportunity of working on European Space Missions such as [Galileo](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Navigation/Galileo/What_is_Galileo) (global navigation satellite system), [Herschel-Planck](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Herschel/ESA_to_launch_two_large_observatories_to_look_deep_into_space_and_time) (space observatories), and [ATV](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/ATV/Mission_concept_and_the_role_of_ATV) (expendable cargo spacecraft).

I later joined [Forem](https://www.leforem.be/what-can-le-forem-do-for-you.html), Public Service for Employment and Vocational Training in Wallonia, Belgium, as a systems architect. My responsibilities included the architecture of the information system, technical design of new applications, technical standards, technology research, technical studies, and proofs of concept. I am still currently working at Forem where I hold the position of Head of Software Engineering Productivity, leading a team of 21 software/DevOps engineers and architects.

## Research

I am conducting research in Computer Science / Software Engineering. My research interests are the following: empirical software engineering, data science in software engineering, technical debt, software/systems architecture, DevOps, machine learning for software engineering.
